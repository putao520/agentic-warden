### REQ-003: Google Drive 配置记录和同步
**Status**: ❌ Disabled (v0.5.19+)
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Version**: v0.1.0
**Related**: ARCH-003, DATA-003

**Description**:
~~Agentic-Warden MUST integrate with Google Drive for selective AI CLI configuration backup and restoration through `push` and `pull` commands, with intelligent file selection to avoid unnecessary data transfer.~~

**Disabled Reason**: Cloud storage integration disabled. Push/pull commands are not available in current version.

### REQ-015: Google Drive OAuth授权流程
**Status**: ❌ Disabled (v0.5.19+)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Version**: v0.5.18
**Related**: ARCH-003, DATA-003

**Description**:
~~Agentic-Warden MUST provide Google Drive OAuth authorization flow that allows users to authenticate with their own Google Drive accounts using only the built-in public OAuth client. MUST comply with SPEC second iron law (no configuration files) and first iron law (no environment variables).~~

**Disabled Reason**: Google Drive OAuth public client is no longer supported by Google. Push/pull commands disabled pending future cloud storage solution.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] **Built-in Public Client**: MUST provide working public OAuth client ID for immediate usage
- [x] **No Application Registration**: Users MUST NOT need to register OAuth applications in Google Cloud Console
- [x] **CLI-Only Authorization**: MUST support headless CLI-based OAuth flow without requiring TUI interfaces
- [x] **Unique Authorization URLs**: MUST generate complete authorization URLs with embedded user code and device code parameters
- [x] **No Configuration Files**: MUST NOT support configuration file-based OAuth credentials (SPEC second iron law compliance)
- [x] **No Environment Variables**: MUST NOT support environment variable configuration (SPEC first iron law compliance)
- [x] **Built-in Client Only**: MUST use only the built-in public OAuth client
- [x] **Public Client Warnings**: MUST display clear warnings when using public client (rate limits, production limitations)
- [x] **English Log Messages**: All OAuth flow messages MUST be in English (no Chinese)
- [x] **Token Persistence**: MUST save and refresh OAuth tokens securely for repeated use

**Standard User Authorization Flow**:

1. **Direct Usage** (Immediate access):
   ```bash
   aiw push    # or aiw pull
   ```
   - System automatically uses built-in public OAuth client
   - Displays complete authorization URL with embedded parameters
   - User opens URL in browser and authenticates with their own Google account
   - User enters the displayed user code to complete authorization
   - OAuth tokens are saved locally for future use

2. **Subsequent Usage**:
   - After successful authorization, credentials are stored locally in `~/.aiw/auth.json`
   - No repeated authorization required for future operations
   - AIW directly operates on the user's own Google Drive
   - Built-in public client is used for all operations

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Public Client ID**: `77185425430.apps.googleusercontent.com` (built-in only)
- **Public Client Secret**: `GOCSPX-1r0aNJW8XY1Mqg4k5L_KzQDGH43` (built-in only)
- **Token Storage**: MUST store tokens in `~/.aiw/auth.json` with 0o600 permissions
- **Authorization URL**: MUST include both user_code and device_code as query parameters
- **Device Flow**: MUST implement RFC 8628 Device Authorization Flow
- **Error Handling**: MUST handle OAuth errors gracefully (invalid_client, access_denied, etc.)
- **Public Client Limitations**: MUST warn about rate limits and production limitations
- **No Configuration Files**: STRICTLY PROHIBITED by SPEC second iron law
- **No Environment Variables**: STRICTLY PROHIBITED by SPEC first iron law

**Public Client Warning Message**:
```
⚠️  Using public OAuth client. It may have limitations. For better results, create your own Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console.
```

**Security Requirements**:
- OAuth tokens MUST be stored with 0o600 permissions (user read/write only)
- Configuration directory MUST have 0o700 permissions (user access only)
- MUST validate OAuth configuration before making API calls
- MUST clear sensitive data from memory when no longer needed
- MUST implement proper token refresh mechanism

**Why No Application Registration Required**:

1. **User's Own Drive Access**: The OAuth flow authorizes AIW to access the user's own Google Drive, following standard OAuth patterns where users grant applications access to their data
2. **Built-in Public Client**: The system provides a working public OAuth client that supports Google Drive API access for device flow authorization
3. **Immediate Usability**: Users can start using the system immediately without needing developers to register separate OAuth applications in Google Cloud Console

**Core Principle**:
Users authenticate AIW to access their own Google Drive accounts through standard OAuth 2.0 Device Flow. This is the normal OAuth pattern where users grant applications permission to access their personal data, rather than developers needing to register applications for each user.

**Configuration File Selection Strategy**:
- **Claude**: `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `agents/`, `skills/SKILL.md`, `hooks/`, `scripts/`, `commands/`, `mcp.json`
- **Codex**: `auth.json`, `config.toml`, `agents.md`, `history.jsonl`
- **Gemini**: `google_accounts.json`, `oauth_creds.json`, `settings.json`, `gemini.md`
- **Exclude**: `.cache/`, `temp/`, `logs/`, `node_modules/`, binaries

**Claude Configuration Details**:
- `hooks/`: Claude Code hook handlers and configuration files (SessionEnd/PreCompact/Stop)
- `scripts/`: Execution scripts including ai-cli-runner.sh and custom workflow scripts
- `commands/`: Custom slash command definitions and configurations
- `mcp.json`: MCP server configuration for Claude Code integration

### REQ-008: 指定供应商模式 AI CLI 启动
**Status**: 🟢 Done
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Version**: v0.5.23 (Enhanced with transparent parameter forwarding)
**Related**: ARCH-002, ARCH-008, API-004

**Description**:
Agentic-Warden MUST provide seamless AI CLI startup with dynamic provider selection through environment variable injection, enabling users to switch between different API providers without modifying AI CLI native configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Support `agentic-warden <ai_type> -p <provider> <prompt>` command syntax
- [x] Transparent environment variable injection before AI CLI process startup
- [x] Provider compatibility validation with AI CLI type before execution
- [x] Fallback to default provider when no provider specified
- [x] Support concurrent AI CLI processes with different providers
- [x] Maintain process isolation and namespace separation per provider
- [x] Handle provider configuration errors gracefully with clear error messages
- [x] Support both single AI CLI and multi-AI CLI execution modes
- [x] Preserve AI CLI native behavior while injecting provider configuration
- [x] Log provider usage for audit and debugging purposes
- [x] **Transparent parameter forwarding**: Parameters starting with `-` (excluding `-p/--provider`) are transparently forwarded to the AI CLI process without interpretation by Agentic-Warden

**Technical Constraints**:
- Environment injection MUST happen before process exec(), not after
- Provider validation MUST occur before process startup
- Process isolation MUST prevent provider cross-contamination
- Error handling MUST provide specific failure reasons
- Command syntax MUST be intuitive and consistent across AI CLI types
- **Parameter parsing**: `-p`/`--provider` parameters are consumed by Agentic-Warden for provider selection; all other `-` prefixed parameters are forwarded transparently to the target AI CLI
- **Parameter order**: Provider flags (`-p`/`--provider`) must be specified before other CLI parameters to ensure proper parsing

**Usage Examples**:
- `agentic-warden claude -p openrouter "Write a Python function"` - Use OpenRouter provider with Claude CLI
- `agentic-warden codex "Debug this code"` - Use default provider with Codex CLI
- `agentic-warden gemini,codex -p litellm "Compare algorithms"` - Multiple AI CLI with same provider
- `agentic-warden claude -p glm --model sonnet --debug api "Explain this code"` - Use GLM provider, forward `--model sonnet --debug api` to Claude CLI
- `agentic-warden claude -p glm --print --output-format json "Get structured response"` - Provider selection with multiple CLI parameters forwarded to Claude CLI
- `agentic-warden codex -p glm --temperature 0.7 --max-tokens 1000 "Generate text"` - Provider selection with CLI parameters forwarded to Codex CLI
- `agentic-warden claude -p auto "Analyze this code"` - Randomly select a compatible provider for Claude CLI
- `agentic-warden claude,codex -p auto "Multi-task"` - Each CLI independently selects a random compatible provider

**`auto` Provider Behavior**:
- When `-p auto` is specified, the system randomly selects one provider from those with `compatible_with` containing the target AI CLI type
- If no compatible providers exist, falls back to default mode (no provider environment injection, AI CLI uses native configuration)
- For multi-CLI execution (`claude,codex -p auto`), each CLI independently selects a random compatible provider
- The actually selected provider name is logged for debugging and audit purposes

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- AIW's `-p/--provider` flag selects the API provider configuration (e.g., glm, openrouter, auto)
- Provider configuration is injected via environment variables, NOT command-line arguments
- All other `-` prefixed parameters are transparently forwarded to the target AI CLI tool
- AI CLI tools maintain their native parameter semantics (e.g., Claude's `-p` for print mode is unrelated to AIW's provider selection)
- `auto` is a reserved provider name that triggers random selection logic

### REQ-009: 交互式 AI CLI 启动
**Status**: 🟢 Done
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Version**: v0.5.23 (Enhanced with transparent parameter forwarding)
**Related**: ARCH-008, API-001

**Description**:
Agentic-Warden MUST support launching AI CLI tools in interactive mode when no task description is provided, while still supporting provider-specific environment variable injection for seamless switching between different API providers.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Support `agentic-warden claude` - launch Claude CLI in interactive mode with default provider
- [x] Support `agentic-warden claude -p openrouter` - launch Claude CLI in interactive mode with OpenRouter provider
- [x] Support `agentic-warden codex --provider litellm` - support long format provider flag in interactive mode
- [x] Support `agentic-warden gemini,prompt -p custom` - multiple AI CLI in interactive mode with custom provider
- [x] Pass all environment variable injection to interactive AI CLI process before startup
- [x] Maintain process tree tracking and task registration for long-running interactive sessions
- [x] Support graceful signal handling (Ctrl+C) compatible with both Agentic-Warden and AI CLI processes
- [x] Detect interactive mode completion when user exits and mark task as completed in shared memory
- [x] Provide clear user feedback showing provider used in interactive mode
- [x] Handle provider validation errors gracefully before launching interactive CLI
- [x] **Interactive mode parameter forwarding**: Support transparent forwarding of CLI parameters (starting with `-`) in interactive mode for full AI CLI feature access

**Technical Constraints**:
- Interactive mode MUST preserve all provider functionality and environment variable injection
- Process tracking MUST work for long-running interactive sessions without memory leaks
- Environment variable injection MUST happen before interactive CLI starts, not during
- Signal handling MUST be compatible with both Agentic-Warden process management and AI CLI signal handling
- Task completion detection MUST work when user exits interactive mode naturally (Ctrl+D, exit command, etc.)
- Interactive mode MUST NOT require additional prompts or confirmation dialogs after provider selection
- Provider compatibility validation MUST occur before process startup
- **Parameter separation**: Provider selection parameters (`-p`/`--provider`) are processed by Agentic-Warden; all other CLI parameters are forwarded to maintain full AI CLI functionality
- **Parameter precedence**: Provider flags must be specified before other CLI parameters to ensure correct parsing and forwarding
- **Mode determination**: Interactive mode is activated when no prompt/task is provided; task mode when prompt is provided
- **Parameter forwarding**: In both modes, non-provider CLI parameters are forwarded to maintain full AI CLI functionality

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Basic interactive mode with default provider
agentic-warden claude
# Output: 🚀 Starting claude in interactive mode (provider: None)

# Interactive mode with specific provider
agentic-warden claude -p openrouter
# Output: 🚀 Starting claude in interactive mode (provider: Some("openrouter"))

# Multiple AI CLI in interactive mode with shared provider
agentic-warden claude,codex -p litellm
# Output: 🚀 Starting claude,codex in interactive mode (provider: Some("litellm"))

# Interactive mode with long format provider flag
agentic-warden gemini --provider custom-proxy
# Output: 🚀 Starting gemini in interactive mode (provider: Some("custom-proxy"))

# Interactive mode with transparent parameter forwarding
agentic-warden claude -p glm --model sonnet --debug api
# Output: 🚀 Starting claude in interactive mode (provider: Some("glm"))
# Forwards: --model sonnet --debug api to Claude CLI

# Interactive mode with multiple CLI parameters
agentic-warden claude -p glm --print --output-format json --allowed-tools Bash,Edit
# Output: 🚀 Starting claude in interactive mode (provider: Some("glm"))
# Forwards: --print --output-format json --allowed-tools Bash,Edit to Claude CLI
```

**Error Handling**:
- Missing provider name after `-p`/`--provider`: Clear error message with usage example
- Invalid provider name: Show available providers and suggest valid alternatives
- Provider compatibility issues: Explain which AI CLI types are supported
- Interactive CLI not found: Suggest installation or alternative CLI types

**Integration Notes**:
- Interactive mode leverages existing `AiCliCommand` infrastructure with empty prompt
- Provider injection works identically to task mode, ensuring consistency
- Process tree tracking continues throughout interactive session
- Task lifecycle follows same pattern: Running → Interactive → Completed

### REQ-010: Claude Code会话历史集成（Hook-Based）
**Status**: 🟢 Done
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Version**: v0.2.0
**Related**: ARCH-010, DATA-010, API-010

**Description**:
Agentic-Warden MUST integrate with Claude Code hooks mechanism to automatically capture and index conversation history for semantic search via MCP tools.

**Architecture**:
Hook-driven design using Claude Code's `SessionEnd` and `PreCompact` hooks to trigger conversation history ingestion. MCP server automatically manages hooks installation/uninstallation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Implement `agentic-warden hooks handle` CLI command
- [x] Read hook input from stdin (session_id, transcript_path, hook_event_name)
- [x] Parse Claude Code JSONL transcript format
- [x] Extract and parse TODO items from conversation content
- [x] Generate embeddings using FastEmbed (AllMiniLML6V2)
- [x] Store conversations in SahomeDB vector database with TODO metadata
- [x] Provide MCP tool: `search_history` for semantic conversation search with TODO context
- [x] Return TODO items alongside conversation results (no separate get_session_todos tool)
- [x] Support session_id-based filtering
- [x] Handle incremental updates (avoid duplicates)
- [x] Auto-install hooks when MCP server starts
- [x] Auto-uninstall hooks when MCP server stops
- [x] RAII cleanup guard for signal/panic safety

**Hook Integration Flow**:
```
Claude Code Session End/PreCompact
    ↓ (trigger hook)
agentic-warden hooks handle
    ↓ (read stdin)
Hook Input JSON: {session_id, transcript_path, hook_event_name}
    ↓ (read JSONL file)
Parse Claude Code JSONL transcript
    ↓ (generate embeddings)
FastEmbed (local, no network)
    ↓ (save to vector DB)
SahomeDB: conversation_history collection
    ↓ (MCP query)
search_history MCP tool
```

**Claude Code Configuration** (~/.config/claude/hooks.json):
```json
{
  "SessionEnd": {
    "command": "agentic-warden hooks handle",
    "stdin": true
  },
  "PreCompact": {
    "command": "agentic-warden hooks handle",
    "stdin": true
  }
}
```

**Note**: This configuration is automatically managed by `agentic-warden mcp` (installs on start, uninstalls on stop). Manual configuration is not required.

**Hook Input Format** (stdin):
```json
{
  "session_id": "session-abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/home/user/.claude/sessions/2025-11-14.jsonl",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
  "cwd": "/home/user/project",
  "permission_mode": "normal"
}
```

**Claude Code JSONL Format**:
```jsonl
{"session_id":"xxx","timestamp":"2025-11-14T10:30:00Z","message_id":"msg-001","role":"user","content":"Help me implement auth"}
{"session_id":"xxx","timestamp":"2025-11-14T10:30:05Z","message_id":"msg-002","role":"assistant","content":"I'll help..."}
```

**TODO Extraction**:
- Parse TODO markers from assistant messages: `- [ ]`, `TODO:`, `Action Items:`
- Extract task description, priority (if present), and context
- Store TODO items as structured metadata alongside conversation records
- `search_history` returns conversations with associated TODO items in response

**Technical Constraints**:
- Vector database: SahomeDB (file-based persistent storage)
- Embedding service: FastEmbed (AllMiniLML6V2, 384 dimensions, local generation)
- Session ID source: Hook stdin input (not parsed from JSONL)
- Semantic search: cosine similarity with configurable threshold
- Storage location: ~/.aiw/conversation_history.db
- Duplicate detection: Check existing session_id before insertion
- TODO extraction: Pattern matching on assistant messages (markdown checkboxes, TODO keywords)
- TODO metadata: Stored as JSON in conversation record metadata field

**Performance Requirements**:
- Hook processing: < 2s for typical session (~100 messages)
- Embedding generation: < 100ms for batch of 10 messages (FastEmbed local)
- Vector insertion: < 500ms for batch of 100 vectors
- MCP search_history: < 200ms for typical query
- Zero network dependency for embeddings

**Error Handling**:
- Hook must return exit code 0 on success
- Hook must return exit code 2 on critical errors (blocks Claude Code)
- Log errors to ~/.aiw/hooks.log
- Gracefully handle missing transcript files
- Skip already-processed sessions

### REQ-012: 智能MCP路由系统
**Status**: 🟢 Done
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Version**: v0.2.0
**Related**: ARCH-012, DATA-012, API-012

**Description**:
Agentic-Warden MUST provide an intelligent MCP (Model Context Protocol) routing system that acts as a meta-MCP gateway with **dynamic tool registration architecture**. The system leverages Claude Code's automatic tool list refresh mechanism: before each tool use, Claude Code calls `list_tools` to get the current tool list. By maintaining an internal thread-safe tools registry (`DynamicToolManager`), we can dynamically expose only relevant tools to Claude Code, achieving **98% token reduction** (50k → 900 tokens) while maintaining full MCP ecosystem access.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

#### 4.1 MCP配置管理
- [x] Support industry-standard `mcp.json` configuration file format
- [x] Provide configuration schema validation and migration support
- [x] Support per-MCP server configuration including command, args, description, category
- [x] Enable/disable individual MCP servers with runtime configuration updates
- [x] Support health check configuration per MCP server (interval, timeout)
- [x] CLI semantics align with Claude Code/Cursor MCP configuration expectations (mcpServers map, command/args/env/description/category/enabled fields)

#### 4.2 双模式向量数据库集成
- [x] **MCP路由模式**: MemVDB for intelligent MCP tool routing and discovery
- [x] **历史会话模式**: SahomeDB for Claude Code conversation history storage and search
- [x] Tool-level indexing: index MCP tools with descriptions and capabilities for routing
- [x] Method-level indexing: index individual methods with detailed schemas for precise routing
- [x] Conversation history: store and search Claude Code conversation history with semantic search
- [x] Maintain metadata associations between tools and methods
- [x] Support batch indexing and incremental updates
- [x] Provide semantic search capabilities with configurable similarity thresholds
- [x] Memory-only MCP index rebuilt on startup from mcp.json configuration

#### 4.3 Claude Code工具刷新机制利用 [基于观察行为]

**信息来源**:
- 基于Claude Code CLI实际行为观察 (2025-11-14测试验证)
- 参考MCP Protocol Specification - `listChanged` capability定义
- **警告**: 此行为基于观察,非官方文档明确保证,未来版本可能变化

**观察到的Claude Code行为**:
- Claude Code在每次调用工具前会自动调用`list_tools`刷新工具列表
- 刷新触发条件: Server Capabilities声明`"listChanged": true`
- 刷新间隔: 实测 < 1s (可能随Claude Code版本变化)
- 刷新时机: 在每次执行工具调用前自动触发

**我们的设计利用**:
- [x] Leverage Claude Code's automatic `list_tools` refresh before each tool use
- [x] No need for notifications/tools/list_changed - Claude Code pulls updates naturally (Pull模式)
- [x] Maintain thread-safe global tools registry (DynamicToolManager)
- [x] Return base tools + dynamically registered tools in `list_tools` response
- [x] Tools become visible to Claude Code on next refresh (typically < 1s)
- [x] Zero client capability detection needed - works universally with MCP-compliant clients

#### 4.4 智能路由算法 (单层简化架构)

**工具选择决策** (选择最佳MCP工具):
- [x] Two-stage vector search: tool-level → method-level semantic search
- [x] LLM-powered decision with confidence scoring (when Ollama available)
- [x] Fallback to pure vector similarity when LLM unavailable
- [x] FastEmbed for local text embedding generation (AllMiniLML6V2, 384-dim)

**动态工具暴露流程**:
1. **用户请求** → `intelligent_route` tool called by Claude Code
2. **智能选择** → Vector search + LLM decision finds best MCP tool
3. **动态注册** → Register selected tool to DynamicToolManager (thread-safe global registry)
4. **自动刷新** → Claude Code calls `list_tools` before next action (< 1s)
5. **工具可见** → Claude Code sees new tool + full schema, calls it with accurate parameters
6. **代理执行** → Our MCP server proxies call to target MCP server
7. **清理优化** → Unregister unused tools to keep token count minimal

**关键优势**:
- ✅ **98% token reduction**: Only expose 2 base tools (Module 2: `search_history`, Module 3: `intelligent_route`) until needed
- ✅ **零延迟感知**: Claude Code's natural refresh cycle (< 1s) provides seamless UX
- ✅ **无需通知**: No notifications/tools/list_changed required - pull model works perfectly
- ✅ **准确参数**: Claude Code generates parameters with full context, not router guessing
- ✅ **通用兼容**: Works with any MCP client that implements `list_tools` (standard behavior)

#### 4.5 动态工具管理 (DynamicToolManager)
- [x] Thread-safe global registry for dynamically registered tools
- [x] Register tools on-demand when `intelligent_route` selects them
- [x] Track tool → MCP server mappings for proxy execution
- [x] Integrated with `list_tools` - returns base + dynamic tools
- [x] Maintain minimal base tool set (2 tools) to reduce token consumption
- [x] Auto-cleanup: Clear unused tools after configurable timeout
- [x] No notifications needed - Claude Code pulls updates via `list_tools`

#### 4.6 统一MCP接口 (跨模块工具暴露)

**基础工具 (始终可见,来自不同模块)**:

- [x] **intelligent_route** (Module 3: MCP Routing): 智能MCP工具选择和动态注册
  - [x] Accepts: `user_request` (用户需求描述), `session_id` (可选)
  - [x] Returns:
    - `selected_tool`: 选中的工具名称
    - `mcp_server`: 所属MCP服务器
    - `description`: 工具功能说明
    - `registered`: 是否已注册到动态工具列表
  - [x] Side effect: 将选中的工具注册到DynamicToolManager
  - [x] Next step: Claude Code refreshes tools, sees new tool, calls it directly

- [x] **search_history** (Module 2: CC Session Management): 会话历史语义搜索（带TODO上下文）
  - [x] Accepts: `query`, `session_id` (optional), `limit`
  - [x] Returns: Conversation records with embedded TODO items
  - [x] TODO extraction patterns: `- [ ]`, `TODO:`, `Action Items:`
  - [x] Each result includes: conversation context + associated TODO list
  - [x] 数据来源: SahomeDB持久化存储的Claude Code会话历史

**动态代理工具** (按需注册):
- [x] 从mcp.json发现的所有MCP工具
- [x] 通过`intelligent_route`选择后动态注册
- [x] 以原始工具名+schema暴露给Claude Code
- [x] 调用时代理到目标MCP服务器
- [x] 支持参数验证和错误处理
- [x] 执行后自动记录到会话历史

#### 4.7 RMCP客户端集成
- [x] Use rmcp library for dynamic MCP server connections
- [x] Maintain connection pool with health monitoring and auto-reconnection
- [x] Support concurrent MCP server operations with proper isolation
- [x] Provide tool schema discovery and caching from connected MCPs
- [x] Handle MCP server lifecycle (start, stop, restart, health checks)

#### 4.8 内部LLM集成
- [x] Integrate Ollama for internal LLM operations (tool selection decisions)
- [x] Support configurable LLM endpoint via environment variable
- [x] Support configurable LLM model via environment variable
- [x] Implement tool selection prompt engineering and response parsing
- [x] Provide clustering analysis and decision-making capabilities
- [x] Handle LLM fallback and error scenarios gracefully

**Technical Constraints**:

#### New Dependencies for REQ-012:
- **FastEmbed-rs**: Local text embedding generation, replacing Ollama for embeddings
  - Model: AllMiniLML6V2 (default), BGEBaseEN (for knowledge)
  - Zero network dependency, 10-50ms local generation
- **SahomeDB**: File-based vector database for conversation history storage
  - Persistent file storage, no external server required
  - Semantic search capabilities with configurable thresholds
- **MemVDB**: In-memory vector database for MCP tool routing
  - Pure memory operations, rebuilt from mcp.json on startup
  - Thread-safe, multiple distance metrics supported
- **Ollama-rs**: Retained for LLM inference (tool selection decisions), not embeddings

#### Configuration Format (mcp.json):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git-server": {
      "command": "mcp-server-git",
      "args": ["--repository", "/workspace"],
      "env": {
        "GIT_REPO_PATH": "/workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Routing Configuration
The intelligent routing system uses hardcoded configuration constants for routing parameters:
- `DEFAULT_MAX_TOOLS_PER_REQUEST`: 10 - Maximum tools to consider per request
- `DEFAULT_CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD`: 0.7 - Vector similarity threshold for tool clustering
- `DEFAULT_RERANK_TOP_K`: 5 - Number of top candidates to rerank
- `DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`: 0.5 - Minimum similarity threshold for tool selection

#### 双模式向量数据库架构:
- **SahomeDB** (File-based Persistent): Claude Code conversation history storage
  - **conversation_history**: Store Claude Code conversation history with semantic search
  - Persistent file-based storage across service restarts
  - Metadata: session_id, timestamp, user, tools_used, conversation_context
  - Long-term memory for conversation retrieval and analysis
  - Semantic search for finding relevant past conversations

- **MemVDB** (In-Memory): MCP intelligent routing index
  - **mcp_tools**: Tool-level vectors with description embedding for routing discovery
  - Pure memory mode, rebuilt on startup from mcp.json configuration
  - Metadata: MCP name, tool name, category, capabilities, health status
  - **mcp_methods**: Method-level vectors with detailed schema embedding for precise routing
  - Real-time MCP tool discovery and intelligent routing decisions
  - Metadata: MCP name, method name, parameters, examples, availability
  - Thread-safe, zero dependencies, multiple distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot-product)

#### Environment Variables:
- `AGENTIC_WARDEN_LLM_ENDPOINT`: Internal LLM endpoint (default: http://localhost:11434)
- `AGENTIC_WARDEN_LLM_MODEL`: Internal LLM model (default: qwen3:1.7b)
- `AGENTIC_WARDEN_FASTEMBED_MODEL`: FastEmbed model (default: AllMiniLML6V2)

#### Algorithm Requirements:
- Vector search MUST use cosine similarity with configurable thresholds
- Clustering algorithm MUST support top-k selection and similarity grouping
- LLM decisions MUST include confidence scoring and fallback handling
- Route caching MUST respect TTL and invalidation strategies

#### Performance Requirements:
- Tool discovery: < 500ms for typical queries
- Method routing: < 1000ms end-to-end including LLM decisions
- MCP connection pool: Support 10+ concurrent connections
- Vector indexing: Batch operations for 1000+ items efficiently

**Usage Examples** (Claude Code Workflow):

```javascript
// Step 1: Claude Code calls intelligent_route to find the right tool
mcp_call("intelligent_route", {
  "user_request": "I want to check git status and commit all changes",
  "session_id": "session-abc123"
})

// Returns:
// {
//   "selected_tool": "git_status",
//   "mcp_server": "git-server",
//   "description": "Get current git repository status",
//   "registered": true  // Tool now in DynamicToolManager
// }

// Step 2: Claude Code automatically calls list_tools (< 1s later)
// Our list_tools returns: ["intelligent_route", "search_history", "git_status"]

// Step 3: Claude Code sees git_status tool with full schema, calls it directly
mcp_call("git_status", {
  "path": "."
})

// Step 4: Our server proxies to git-server MCP, returns result:
// "On branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  modified:   src/main.rs\n"
```

**Key Insight**: Claude Code handles the tool refresh automatically. We just maintain the global tools registry, and Claude Code discovers new tools via its natural `list_tools` polling.

**Integration Points**:
- rmcp client library for MCP server connections
- Qdrant Server (HTTP API) for persistent historical data
- MemVDB for in-memory MCP routing index
- Ollama integration for internal LLM operations
- Existing memory module for embedding services
- Existing configuration system for mcp.json management

**Technical Dependencies**:
- `memvdb` = "0.1" # Fast, lightweight in-memory vector database
- `rmcp` = { version = "0.5", features = ["server", "transport-io", "macros"] }
- `ollama-rs` = "0.3.1" # For internal LLM communication
- Existing Qdrant HTTP integration (via reqwest)
- Existing embedding service (Ollama)

### REQ-013: 动态JS编排工具系统

**Priority**: High
**Status**: 🟢 Done
**Related**: REQ-012, ARCH-012
**Version**: v0.2.0

#### 背景和动机

intelligent_route当前只能选择单个MCP工具,对于复杂的多步骤任务需要用户多次调用工具。通过引入Boa JS引擎和LLM驱动的代码生成,我们可以动态创建组合多个MCP工具的编排工具,一次调用完成复杂工作流。

#### 核心功能需求

#### 5.1 DynamicToolRegistry (动态工具注册表)

**作为MCP工具定义的SSOT**:
- [x] 内部维护所有可被映射到MCP协议的工具定义
- [x] 支持两类工具:基础工具(永久) + 动态工具(带TTL)
- [x] 每次Claude Code调用`list_tools`时从Registry读取工具列表
- [x] 工具名称和schema在TTL内保持稳定不变
- [x] 提供线程安全的并发读写操作

**基础工具管理**:
- [x] 启动时初始化基础工具: `intelligent_route`, `search_history`
- [x] 基础工具永久存在,不受TTL影响

**动态工具管理**:
- [x] 支持注册两种动态工具类型:
  - JS编排工具 (`JsOrchestratedTool`)
  - 代理MCP工具 (`ProxiedMcpTool`)
- [x] 每个动态工具带有TTL = **600秒(10分钟)**
- [x] 自动清理过期工具(后台任务,每60秒检查一次)
- [x] 支持最大动态工具数限制(默认100个),超出时驱逐最旧工具
- [x] 记录工具注册时间、执行次数等元数据

#### 5.2 intelligent_route LLM优先路由 (带Fallback)

**路由决策逻辑**:
- [x] **LLM不存在** → 直接使用向量搜索模式(不尝试LLM,节省时间)
- [x] **LLM存在** → 优先尝试LLM编排,失败则fallback到向量搜索

**执行流程**:
```rust
match js_orchestrator {
    None => vector_mode(),           // LLM不存在,直接vector
    Some(orch) => {
        match try_llm_orchestrate() {
            Ok(result) => result,     // LLM成功
            Err(_) => vector_mode(),  // LLM失败,fallback
        }
    }
}
```

**LLM编排模式** (优先尝试):
- [x] LLM分析用户任务,规划所需步骤和MCP工具
- [x] 检查是否有合适的工具支持,不可行时返回Err触发fallback
- [x] **智能注册决策** (needs_orchestration字段):
  - `needs_orchestration = false`: 单工具直接透传,注册为代理工具(ProxiedMcpTool)
  - `needs_orchestration = true`: 需要JS编排,生成JS代码并注册为编排工具(JsOrchestratedTool)
- [x] **触发JS编排的条件** (任一满足):
  - 多步骤工作流(steps > 1)
  - 需要转换/过滤/聚合输出数据
  - 需要条件逻辑或循环
  - 需要组合多个工具的结果
- [x] **直接代理的条件** (全部满足):
  - 单步骤(steps = 1)
  - 输入参数直接透传到目标工具
  - 无输出处理需求
- [x] JS函数内部调用注入的MCP工具(以`mcp`前缀暴露)
- [x] 代码验证失败时返回Err触发fallback
- [x] 返回消息: "Use the 'xxx' tool to solve your problem"

**向量搜索模式** (Fallback保障):
- [x] 两层向量搜索(工具级 + 方法级)
- [x] 聚类算法筛选出top-N候选工具(默认5个)
- [x] 批量注册为代理工具到Registry(透传原始MCP定义)
- [x] 返回消息: "Found N relevant tools. Choose which ones to use: ..."

**Fallback触发条件**:
- LLM环境未配置 (`js_orchestrator = None`)
- LLM网络请求超时或失败
- LLM返回无效响应或代码
- JS代码验证失败(语法错误、安全检查未通过)
- LLM判断任务不可行

#### 5.3 Boa JS引擎集成

**安全沙箱**:
- [x] 使用Boa引擎提供安全的JS运行时环境
- [x] 禁用危险全局对象: `eval`, `Function`, `require`, `import`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`
- [x] 实现执行时间限制(最大10分钟)
- [x] 提供安全的`console.log`(仅用于调试)

**MCP函数注入**:
- [x] 将可用的MCP工具注入为JS异步函数
- [x] 函数命名规范: `mcp` + CamelCase (例: `git_status` → `mcpGitStatus`)
- [x] 注入函数实现异步调用RMCP Client Pool
- [x] 支持参数解析和结果转换(JSON ↔ JS Value)
- [x] 错误处理和异常传播

**运行时池管理**:
- [x] 使用连接池管理Boa运行时实例(复用,减少初始化开销)
- [x] 支持并发执行多个JS工具
- [x] 运行时隔离(每次执行独立的context)

#### 5.4 LLM驱动的代码生成

**工作流规划**:
- [x] LLM分析用户任务和可用MCP工具列表
- [x] 判断任务是否可行(is_feasible: true/false)
- [x] 规划执行步骤(steps: [{step, tool, description}, ...])
- [x] 确定所需输入参数(因为MCP只接收"做什么",不包含具体上下文)
- [x] 建议工具名称(snake_case)和描述

**JS代码生成**:
- [x] 根据规划生成完整的`async function workflow(input) {...}`
- [x] 生成的代码使用注入的MCP函数(mcp前缀)
- [x] 包含错误处理(try-catch)
- [x] 包含注释说明每个步骤
- [x] 返回结构化结果对象

**代码验证**:
- [x] 语法检查(使用Boa解析)
- [x] 安全性检查(检测危险模式: eval, new Function, __proto__等)
- [x] 检查只使用允许的MCP函数
- [x] Dry-run测试(使用mock数据执行一次)

#### 5.5 工具执行和生命周期

**JS工具执行**:
- [x] 从Registry获取工具定义
- [x] 从运行时池获取Boa实例
- [x] 注入所需的MCP函数
- [x] 执行JS代码,传入用户参数
- [x] 返回结果给Claude Code
- [x] 更新执行计数统计

**代理工具执行**:
- [x] 从Registry获取工具定义
- [x] 通过RMCP Client Pool代理到目标MCP服务器
- [x] 透传参数和结果
- [x] 更新执行计数统计

**TTL和清理**:
- [x] 动态工具TTL = **600秒(10分钟)**
- [x] 后台任务每60秒检查并清理过期工具
- [x] 超出最大工具数时驱逐最旧工具
- [x] 清理时记录日志

#### 技术约束

**新增依赖**:
```toml
boa_engine = "0.17"         # Rust实现的JavaScript引擎
boa_gc = "0.17"             # Boa垃圾回收
swc_ecma_parser = "0.142"   # 快速JS解析器(用于验证)
swc_ecma_ast = "0.110"      # AST分析
deadpool = "0.10"           # 异步对象池(Boa运行时池)
regex = "1.10"              # 危险模式检测
```

**性能目标**:
| 操作 | 目标延迟 | 说明 |
|-----|---------|------|
| LLM规划 | < 3s | Ollama本地推理 |
| JS代码生成 | < 3s | Ollama本地推理 |
| 代码验证 | < 100ms | 语法+安全检查 |
| Boa初始化 | < 50ms | 从池获取 |
| MCP函数注入 | < 200ms | 批量注册 |
| JS工具执行 | < 30s | 取决于MCP调用数 |
| 工具注册 | < 10ms | 写入Registry |
| list_tools响应 | < 50ms | 读取Registry |

**安全要求**:
- JS代码必须通过安全性检查
- 禁止使用危险的JavaScript特性
- 执行时间和内存限制
- 运行时隔离

**可靠性要求**:
- 工具注册失败不影响现有工具
- JS执行错误不导致服务崩溃
- 过期工具清理不阻塞主流程

### REQ-018: MCP Browse 环境变量快速跳过
**Status**: ✅ 已实现 (2025-12-26) [commit: 3a9f72a]
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Version**: v0.6.1
**Related**: ARCH-018, REQ-016

**Description**:
Agentic-Warden MCP Browse TUI MUST support one-key skip for all remaining optional environment variables during interactive MCP installation. Users can quickly skip optional configuration steps without entering individual values.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] In environment variable input dialog, display hint when optional variables remain
- [ ] Pressing 'a' or 'A' key skips all remaining optional environment variables
- [ ] Only works when current variable is optional (skip has no effect on required vars)
- [ ] Returns to MCP installation with remaining required variables still collected
- [ ] Behavior is intuitive and non-destructive (can still edit optional vars individually)
- [ ] Unit test: test_env_input_skip_all_optional passes

**Technical Constraints**:
- Integration with existing `EnvInputState` in `src/commands/mcp/registry/browse.rs`
- Extends enum-based event handling pattern (no major refactor)
- Display hint in env dialog footer when optional vars exist
- Call `skip_all_optional()` method on `EnvInputState`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] New menu option "Installed MCPs" in Browse main screen (Press 'i')
- [ ] Display list of installed MCP servers with name, description, enabled status
- [ ] Search by name using '/' key (real-time filtering)
- [ ] Filter by status (enabled/disabled) using keyboard
- [ ] Show environment variable count per MCP
- [ ] Press Enter on MCP to view detailed configuration
- [ ] Details view shows: name, source, environment variables, command
- [ ] Return to list with ESC key
- [ ] Return to main Browse menu with ESC from list view
- [ ] Handle empty list gracefully (no installed MCPs)
- [ ] Integration test passes

**Data Structures**:
```rust
struct InstalledMcpListItem {
    name: String,
    description: String,
    enabled: bool,
    env_var_count: usize,
    source: String,
}

struct InstalledMcpScreen {
    items: Vec<InstalledMcpListItem>,
    selected_index: usize,
    search_query: String,
    filtered_items: Vec<usize>,
}
```

**Technical Constraints**:
- Read from `McpConfigManager::load()` existing implementation
- Reuse existing screen pattern from `DashboardScreen`, `StatusScreen`

- [ ] Show confirmation before overwriting config
- [ ] Graceful error handling for file write failures
- [ ] Log changes for audit trail
- [ ] Integration test passes

**Edit Mode Workflow**:
```
InstalledMcpScreen
    ↓ (select MCP, press 'e')
EditEnvState (setup)
    ↓ (preload existing values)
EnvInputState (use existing component)
    ↓ (user modifies values)
Save confirmation (press 's')
    ↓ (persist to mcp.json)
Return to list (show success/error)
```

**Data Structures**:
```rust
struct EditEnvState {
    server_name: String,
    env_input: EnvInputState,
    original_values: HashMap<String, String>,
    modified: bool,
}

impl EditEnvState {
    fn apply_changes(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Update McpConfigManager and save to mcp.json
    }
}
```

**Technical Constraints**:
- Reuse `EnvInputState` from REQ-018
- Use existing `McpConfigManager::update_server_env()` method
- Extend `InstalledMcpScreen` or create new `EditEnvScreen`
- Persist changes using `McpConfigManager::save()`
- Handle file locking for concurrent access
- File: modify `src/tui/screens/installed_mcp.rs`
