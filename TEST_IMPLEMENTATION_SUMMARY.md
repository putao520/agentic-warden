- ✅ Listing providers (empty, multiple)
- ✅ Getting providers (exists, not found)
- ✅ Deleting providers (success, not found, default protection)
- ✅ Setting default providers (basic, override, get default, non-existent)

#### B. Environment Variable Mapping (3 tests)
- ✅ Codex environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL, OPENAI_ORG_ID)
- ✅ Claude environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL)
- ✅ Gemini environment variables (GOOGLE_API_KEY, https_proxy)

#### C. Environment Variable Injection (4 tests)
- ✅ Environment variable injection to commands
- ✅ Sensitive value masking (API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets)
- ✅ Non-sensitive value preservation (URLs, model names)
- ✅ Short value masking (complete masking for short values)

#### D. Provider Persistence (3 tests)
- ✅ Save and reload provider configurations
- ✅ Default provider persistence across sessions
- ✅ File permissions on Unix systems (0o600 for files, 0o700 for directories)

#### E. Validation and Error Handling (6 tests)
- ✅ Empty provider names (documented as allowed but not recommended)
- ✅ Reserved name protection ("official" cannot be added/deleted)
- ✅ AI type compatibility validation
- ✅ Multi-AI provider compatibility
- ✅ Setting non-existent provider as default (error handling)

#### F. Complete Lifecycle (3 tests)
- ✅ Full CRUD lifecycle (add → set default → save → reload → remove)
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization roundtrip
- ✅ AiType Display and FromStr trait implementations

**Key Features Tested:**
- Multi-AI type support (Codex, Claude, Gemini)
- Environment variable masking for security
- Configuration file persistence
- Reserved name protection
- Comprehensive error handling

**Test Methodology:**
- Uses temporary directories for isolation
- No interference with real configuration files
- Each test is independent and can run in any order

### 2. Push/Pull Integration Tests (`tests/push_pull_integration_test.rs`)

**18 comprehensive tests covering:**

#### A. Authentication Detection (3 tests)
- ✅ Auth file exists detection
- ✅ Auth file missing detection
- ✅ Auth file creation and cleanup workflow

#### B. Authentication Directory Structure (2 tests)
- ✅ Directory creation (~/.agentic-warden)
- ✅ Directory permissions on Unix (0o700)

#### C. Mock Auth Data Validation (2 tests)
- ✅ Auth data structure (access_token, refresh_token, expires_in, token_type)
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization

#### D. Push/Pull Screen States (2 tests - Conceptual)
- ✅ Push mode transitions documented (CheckingAuth → Ready/NeedAuth → Running → Completed)
- ✅ Pull mode transitions documented (same flow as Push)

#### E. Progress Steps (2 tests - Conceptual)
- ✅ Push steps: Initializing → Compressing → Uploading → Verifying → Completed
- ✅ Pull steps: Initializing → Downloading → Decompressing → Restoring → Completed

#### F. Integration Workflows (2 tests)
- ✅ Complete push workflow simulation (auth present vs missing)
- ✅ Complete pull workflow simulation (auth present vs missing)

#### G. Error Handling (2 tests)
- ✅ Invalid JSON in auth file
- ✅ Missing required fields in auth data

#### H. Cleanup and Safety (2 tests)
- ✅ Backup and restore mechanism
- ✅ Cleanup removes auth file correctly

#### I. Format Utilities (1 test)
- ✅ Byte formatting concept (bytes, KB, MB, GB)

**Key Features Tested:**
- Authentication file detection without touching real auth
- State transition documentation for UI screens
- Progress tracking concepts
- Safe backup/restore mechanisms
- Error handling for invalid auth data

**Test Methodology:**
- Uses temporary directories exclusively (never touches ~/.agentic-warden/auth.json)
- Safe for running on developer machines
- Documents expected behavior even when components aren't fully testable
- Fast execution (< 20ms for all 18 tests)

**Important Safety Feature:**
All tests use temporary directories and mock files. The real `~/.agentic-warden/auth.json` is **never** modified or deleted, ensuring developer auth credentials remain safe.

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Temporary Directories for All Tests
**Decision:** Use `TempDir` for all file operations instead of mocking  
**Rationale:** 
- Real file I/O tests actual behavior
- Automatic cleanup prevents test pollution
- Safe for developer machines
- More realistic than mocks

### 2. No Modification of Real Auth Files
**Decision:** Never touch `~/.agentic-warden/auth.json`  
**Rationale:**
- Protects developer credentials
- Prevents test-induced auth failures
- Safer CI/CD integration
- Mock files provide adequate testing

### 3. Conceptual Tests for UI Screens
**Decision:** Document expected behavior instead of testing internal state  
**Rationale:**
- PushScreen/PullScreen don't expose testable state
- Refactoring for testability would complicate actual code
- Documentation provides value for future implementation
- Integration tests can be added when screens expose state

### 4. Real Compression in Tests
**Decision:** Use actual TAR.GZ compression instead of mocks  
**Rationale:**
- Tests real compression behavior
- Validates format compatibility
- Tests still run fast (< 50ms)
- Catches compression-specific bugs

### 5. Comprehensive Test Helpers
**Decision:** Create extensive shared utilities  
**Rationale:**
- Reduces duplication (DRY principle)
- Consistent test data
- Easier to add new tests
- Unit tests for helpers ensure reliability
